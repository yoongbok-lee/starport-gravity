 - install starport.
 - start gravity process through starport with `starport serve --force-reset`.
 - download `client`, `orchestrator`, and `setup-orch.sh` in the same directory.
 - in `setup-orch.sh`, modify the `cosphr` variable to what's shown as `alice`'s private mnemonics.
 - run `setup.orch.sh`. Occasionally the orchestrator might lag a bit and not produce a erc20 representation of the cosmos native token. Just re-run the last command `orchestrator deploy-erc20-representation...`
 - in the frontend `localhost:8080/types` you can create some cosmos->eth txs.
 - run `client build-batch` to confirm batch transaction on ethereum.
 - see the txs go through.
